INTELLIGENCE TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT 
---------------------------------------------
In our projected solution, the system efficiently detects emergency vehicles and calculates the 
average vehicle area, aiming to streamline traffic control processes and mitigate existing delays. 
Additionally, it facilitates the optimal routing of emergency vehicles, ensuring prompt response 
and minimizing travel time to critical locations. The incorporation of YOLOv4 and MobileNet 
algorithms, trained over 10 epochs with an impressive accuracy of 95.49%, underscores the 
robustness and effectiveness of our solution in improving urban traffic management and 
emergency vehicle prioritization.
